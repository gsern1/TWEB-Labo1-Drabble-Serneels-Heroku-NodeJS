# TWEB-Labo1-Drabble-Serneels-Heroku-NodeJS

This repository contains a simple node.js web app displaying an index.html page using the Photon template https://html5up.net/photon

The web app is typically reached from a landing page using the same template, code available on the 'gh pages' branch of this repo.

During the next lab sessions we will improve this app to make it a GitHub Explorer, displaying usage statistics from github.com. 

To visit the landing page of the app, you go to https://gsern1.github.io/TWEB-Labo1-Drabble-Serneels-Heroku-NodeJS/
