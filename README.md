# TWEB-Labo1-Drabble-Serneels-Heroku-NodeJS

This repository contains a simple node.js web app displaying an index.html page using the Photon template https://html5up.net/photon

The web app is typically reached from a landing page using the same template, code available on the 'gh-pages' branch of this repo.

The top right 'Landing Page' button allows the user to navigate back to the landing page from the web app.

During the next lab sessions we will improve this app to make it a GitHub Explorer, displaying usage statistics from github.com. 

To visit the landing page of the app, you go to https://gsern1.github.io/TWEB-Labo1-Drabble-Serneels-Heroku-NodeJS/
